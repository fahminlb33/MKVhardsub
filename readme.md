# MKVhardsub

Little tool to create *hardsubbed* MP4 video from MKV video container.

This tool is still **work in progress**, use it at your own risk. This tool is made using the power of
**ffmpeg** and **MKVToolNix** with helps from **gMKVExtractGUI**. Licensed under GNU General Public
License version 3.

This tool can help you to create hardsubbed MP4 video from MKV video. This tool is designed with many
advantages against SubStation Alpha subtitle.

1. Keep subtitle style (fonts, colour, anything).
2. Encode output video to MP4 container using **ffmpeg** x264.
3. Easy to use with embedded subtitle inside MKV or external subtitle file.
4. Supports both x86 and x64 version of Windows.

## How To Use

1. Download *ffmpeg* and *MKVToolNix*, place it on *bin* folder.
```
Place those files here : <ProjectOutput>\bin.
So, the bin folder will contain ffmpeg.exe, mkvmerge.exe and mkvextract.exe.
```

2. Run MKVhardsub from Visual Studio or build it with MSBuild.

3. You should be can use it even without more further tutorial :D

This repo has a ready alpha release for 64-bit version of Windows, supporting Vista and greater. Don't
forget to match your computer processor. Of course you can build MKVhardsub as x86 binary and run it on
x64 machine, but you will loose many speed optimization.

### Important Note for Debugging and Usage

Always match *ffmpeg* and *MKVToolNix* binary version. If you are running on x86 machine of course you
need all of those binaries in x86 version. But if you are running it in x64 machine you need to match
*ffmpeg* and *MKVToolNix* version to match MKVhardsub release configuration. Because x64 process can't
access x86 process and vice versa.
